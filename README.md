# terraform-aws
This is a terraform script that will create a WORDPRESS instance that uses MySQL DB from different EC2 instance using AWS providers and modules.  
This script will also create 2 subnets and 1 vpc.  
a public subnet for Wordpress,  
and one private subnet for MySQL DB.  

First you will need to install AWS CLI 2 , via the amazon official site.  

Use in commend line :

```aws configure```

Input the following data : 

```AWS Access Key ID [None]: accesskey``` 
```AWS Secret Access Key [None]: secretkey``` 
```Default region name [None]: your required region name```    
```Default output format [None]: json```

Generate key-pair for EC2.  
Write down the key-pair name in ec2.tf in lines [17, 31, 52]  
and make sure the pem file is located next to the main.tf


Before running the terraform script make sure use the following commend:   

```terraform init```

After downloading the required providers use the next commend to make sure there are no errors:  

```terraform plan```

And after making sure there are zero problems you can start the script via the :

```terraform apply```

now you should access the wordpress via the public IP of your newly created EC2.
